1)    A school   has   1600 students and they   are   going   to   vote   as   to   whether   they
will completely convert the school completely   oﬀ fossil fuels.   How   many
students would you   have to   poll to   be 95% conﬁdent of   the   outcome   within   +/- 0.5% of the   vote?   (25   points)
2)      Earthquakes can   be   broken   into two classes   based on the   directions the
earth   moves when they fracture. The classes can   be compared   across   time,   for whether earthquakes occur   in a given   region   in   a   small   time   period,   and   if they occur   in the   next small time   period, and   it   can   be   added   up   across
several time   periods,   below   is a table for a   region oﬀ   Indonesia   over   a   30   year   period
Second time period, earthquake happens Second time period no earthquake happens Marginal Sums First time period, Earthquake happens 148 274 422 First time period no earthquake happens 276 2626 2902 Marginal sums 424 2900 3324 
Is   happening of an earthquake   in one time   period   statistically   independent   of   happening   in the   next time   period? Test at the   .01   level   (20   points)
These are earthquakes of the same type, Which cells have higher than expected occurrence if independence is true. (Use the deviation table). (10 points) 
3)    The earthquake chart   is the same   chart,   only   comparing when   earthquakes   of diﬀerent types follow   one   another
Second time period, earthquake happens Second time period no earthquake happens Marginal Sums First time period, Earthquake happens 5 314 319 First time period no earthquake happens 314 2691 3005 Marginal sums 319 3005 3324 
Are they statistically   independent   now   (.01   level again)   (16   points)
How do the deviations from expectation   under   independence   diﬀer from the   chart   in   problem   2   (hint   look at the   pattern of   pluses and   minuses)   (8   points)
If you think about what each cell   means, what   do   these   diﬀerences   mean   in   terms   of the way the two types of earthquakes   interact   (6   points)
4) In   NCI60   in the   ISLR   data set (100) 
a.      Identify the cancer types with   more than   3 cell   lines   present.
b.      From those   Identify cancers with   hyper or   hypo active   genes   at   the   0.2   FDR   level   (not   independent)
c.      代 写Final 291 section 2Python
代做程序编程语言 Identify common genes   between every   pair of the   cancers   identiﬁed   in   b.
d.    Are there any genes shared   as   strangely   active   between   3   cancers?5)    The diabetes data set   is   a   prospective   study   of   onset   of   adult   diabetes given
a   number of   risk factors among the   Pima   Indian tribe.   Using the   diabetes.csv data set (100) 
a.      Separate the ﬁrst   half of the data from the second   half,   use   the   ﬁrst   half for training, second for testing
b.      Using the training   data
i.       Construct the full   logistic   regression   model for outcome
ii.       Using   backwards selection construct the   logistic   regression   model with every   p value for the coeﬃcients   < .05 (Show Steps!!!)
c.       Predict the “response”   (eg type=”response”) for the full   logistic   regression   model for
i.      the training data   set,
ii.          the test   data set,
d.      Predict the “response” for the smallest   logistic   model from the   backwards selection exercise
i.      the training   data set,
ii.          the test   data set,
e.      Using   random forest,   build a   model on the training   data
f.       You   now   have 3   models,   Full   Logistic, smallest   logistic,   and   random   forest.   For   predictions of each calculate and   tabulate
i.       Number   of correct   positives
ii.       Number   of   False   positives
iii.       Number of   correct   negatives
iv.       Number   of false   negatives.
g.      Using the   results off,   is there one of the   3   methods which   appears
best   in   modeling   new   results, or does   it depend on   whether   it   is   more   important to   identify   positives   (predict   diabetes) or   negatives   (predict   health)
h.      Now   redo analysis twice   using   random selection of 384   out   of   768 for   training and the complement for testing.   Is there anything   you   can conclude with this additional   information about the   merits of   each   approach?
6)    Conceptual question: Suppose you   have   a   null   and   alternative   hypotheses
that are completely deﬁned   in terms of the   speciﬁc   probability   distributions      they   represent. What   is the   main diﬀerence   between   using a   likelihood   ratio   test, and   using   bayes   rule to decide   between the two. (20)
